# AFM DevSecOps Project Portfolio

## 🔹 Project Overview
AFM (App Feature / Microservice) is a production-style banking domain application designed to demonstrate **real-world DevOps and DevSecOps practices** using AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, and modern security & observability tooling.

This project is **not a tutorial-based setup**.  
It is built incrementally from scratch with:
- Infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes deployments
- Security scanning
- Monitoring & failure simulations

---

## 🔹 Why This Project Exists
Most DevOps projects stop at:
- Docker build
- Simple CI pipeline
- Basic Kubernetes deployment

AFM goes beyond that by addressing:
- Infrastructure as Code
- Production-like CI/CD
- Security as part of pipeline (DevSecOps)
- Observability
- Upgrade & failure handling strategies

---

## 🔹 High-Level Architecture (Preview)
> Detailed architecture diagrams and explanations are provided in later sections.

- AWS Cloud (VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, IAM)
- GitLab CI/CD for pipelines
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- ALB Ingress for traffic routing
- Prometheus, Grafana & CloudWatch for monitoring
- SonarQube, Trivy & OWASP ZAP for security

---

## 🔹 Project Status
**Current State:**  
✔ Infrastructure provisioned using Terraform  
✔ CI/CD pipelines implemented in GitLab  
✔ Application deployed on EKS  
✔ ALB ingress working  
✔ DevSecOps tools integrated  
✔ Monitoring enabled  
✔ Failure simulations performed  

---

## 🔹 Repository Purpose
This GitHub repository contains:
- 📘 Project documentation
- 🧠 Architecture explanations
- 🧪 Failure scenarios & learnings
- 🎯 Interview-ready explanations

> **Note:**  
> The actual source code and CI/CD pipelines are maintained in **GitLab**, as this project focuses on **real enterprise workflows**.
