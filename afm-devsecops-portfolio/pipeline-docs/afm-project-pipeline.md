# 🚀 AFM Application DevSecOps Pipeline

### CI/CD for AFM Microservices on Amazon EKS

---

## 🔰 Overview
The **AFM Application Pipeline** is responsible for building, securing, packaging, deploying, and validating the **AFM microservices** running on Amazon EKS.

Unlike simplistic CI/CD demos, this pipeline is designed to reflect **real DevSecOps workflows**, where:
- Security is enforced at multiple stages
- Builds are reproducible
- Deployments are controlled
- Runtime behavior is validated post-deployment

The pipeline applies to all AFM services:
- `frontend-ui`
- `login-service`
- `registration-service`
- `auth-service`

Each service follows the **same standardized pipeline**, ensuring consistency and scalability.

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

The AFM application pipeline was built with the following principles:
- **Shift-left security**
- **Immutable container images**
- **Separation of build, security, and runtime testing**
- **No manual server access**
- **Environment parity between services**
- **Cost-aware execution**

This mirrors how **enterprise DevOps teams** operate application platforms.

---
## 🧱 Pipeline Responsibilities

This pipeline is responsible for:
- Compiling AFM services
- Performing static and image security scans
- Building Docker images
- Publishing images to Amazon ECR
- Deploying services to EKS
- Running runtime security tests
- Producing security and scan reports

Infrastructure provisioning and observability setup are handled by **separate pipelines**.

## 🚦 High-Level Pipeline Flow

```
Code Commit
   ↓
Build & Test
   ↓
SAST (SonarQube)
   ↓
Docker Image Build
   ↓
Image Scan (Trivy)
   ↓
Push to Amazon ECR
   ↓
Deploy to Amazon EKS
   ↓
DAST (OWASP ZAP)
```


Each stage acts as a **quality and security gate**.

---

## 🛠️ Pipeline Stages (Detailed)

---

### 1️⃣ Source Code Commit
- Developers commit changes to the AFM repository
- Each microservice is maintained as a separate logical unit
- The pipeline is triggered manually or via controlled execution

This avoids uncontrolled deployments and reflects **production discipline**.

---
### 2️⃣ Build & Compile (Maven)

- Java-based AFM services are compiled using Maven
- Ensures:
    - Dependency resolution
    - Build reproducibility
    - Early failure detection

Build artifacts are **not deployed directly** — containers are used instead.

---

### 3️⃣ Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- **SonarQube** scans source code
- Detects:
    - Code smells
    - Security hotspots
    - Vulnerable patterns

This stage enforces **code-level security before containerization**.

---

### 4️⃣ Docker Image Build
- Each AFM service is containerized
- Images are:
    - Immutable
    - Versioned
    - Tagged per pipeline execution

This ensures **build once, deploy everywhere** semantics.

---

### 5️⃣ Software Composition & Image Security Scan (SCA)

- **Trivy** scans Docker images
- Detects:
    - OS-level vulnerabilities
    - Library CVEs
    - Known insecure packages

Only scanned images are allowed to proceed.

---

### 6️⃣ Push to Amazon ECR
- Approved images are pushed to **Amazon ECR**
- ECR serves as the **single source of truth** for deployments
- Kubernetes pulls images directly from ECR

No images are built on cluster nodes.

---
### 7️⃣ Deployment to Amazon EKS

- Kubernetes manifests deploy AFM services into:
    - Namespace: `afm-bank`
- Services are deployed as:
    - Pods behind ClusterIP services
- Only the frontend is exposed via Ingress and ALB

This enforces **strong network boundaries**.

---

### 8️⃣ Runtime Security Testing (DAST)
- **OWASP ZAP** runs **after deployment**
- ZAP targets:
    - AWS Application Load Balancer URL
- Tests:
    - Authentication flows
    - Input validation
    - HTTP security headers
    - Runtime vulnerabilities

ZAP is **not part of the live traffic flow** and runs on-demand.

---

### 9️⃣ Security Report Generation
- SonarQube, Trivy, and ZAP generate:
    - HTML reports
    - JSON artifacts
- Reports are stored as pipeline artifacts
- Enables:
    - Auditing
    - Review
    - Learning from findings

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Configuration Management
- Secrets are managed using **GitLab CI/CD protected variables**
- No credentials are hardcoded in:
    - Source code
    - Docker images
    - Kubernetes manifests

Future enhancements include:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- IRSA-based access

---
## ⚠️ Real Challenges Encountered

### Pipeline Execution Constraints
- Single EC2 runner handling:
    - Builds
    - Docker images
    - Security scans
### Resolution
- Disk expansion (8 GB → 20 GB)
- Cleanup of unused Docker layers
- Controlled pipeline execution

These challenges mirror **real operational learning**.

## 🔁 Relationship with Other Pipelines

|Pipeline|Responsibility|
|---|---|
|**afm-infra-pipeline**|Provisions AWS & EKS|
|**afm-project-pipeline**|Builds & deploys AFM services|
|**afm-observability-pipeline**|Monitoring & alerting|

This separation ensures:
- Reduced blast radius
- Clear ownership
- Easier debugging

---

## 🧠 Why This Pipeline Matters

This pipeline demonstrates:
- Real DevSecOps layering
- Secure CI/CD design
- Kubernetes deployment maturity
- Runtime security validation
- Production-style discipline

It is **not a toy pipeline**, but a **controlled application delivery system**.

---

## 🔚 Final Takeaway

> The AFM application pipeline treats application delivery as a **secure, repeatable, and auditable process**, aligning with real-world DevSecOps practices.
